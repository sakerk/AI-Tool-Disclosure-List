# Purpose
These documents provide a generalized overview of both commercial and open-source AI-assisted tools commonly used in visual effects (VFX) and animation (ANM) production workflows. The intent is to support vendors, studios, and artists in maintaining transparency and compliance with contractual, legal, or security  requirements that may restrict or require prior approval for the use of AI technologies.

The tools described vary in form and integration. Some are embedded within industry-standard software, while others are standalone applications or interfaces layered on top of open-source or commercial platforms. These tools are typically used to enhance, accelerate, or automate specific production tasks. They do not generate original creative content autonomously, but rather assist artists in achieving production goals more efficiently and consistently.

Disclaimer:
This list is not exhaustive and is subject to periodic updates as new tools emerge and existing technologies evolve. We recommend reviewing the latest version prior to each production cycle to ensure continued compliance and transparency.

If you have any concerns, corrections, or additions, please submit them for review so we can maintain the accuracy and relevance of this resource.

##  How to Read and Use the Tool Disclosure Table

This table helps studios, legal departments, auditors, vendors, and artists maintain transparency around AI-assisted tools in VFX and animation workflows. Each column provides specific information relevant to legal, ethical, and production compliance.

## Output Handling and Risk Level Categories

| Category | Approval Status | Risk Level | What it Means | Examples | Why |
|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|----------|-----|
| **Standard Software Features** | No Approval Required | Low | AI functions embedded in licensed, industry-standard tools. | Adobe After Effects motion tracking, Foundry Nuke denoising, Autodesk Flame cleanup | These are standard features of professional tools, not considered “AI-generated deliverables.” |
| **Generative Content** | Approval Required |  High | AI that generates new expressive content (images, video, text, audio) that could be used in deliverables. | Adobe Firefly, RunwayML, Stable Diffusion (ComfyUI/Automatic1111), Topaz AI upscaling | This is the risk area Studio Execs/Producers want to control. AI-created content in the finished product. |
| **Assisted, Artist-Controlled** | No Approval Required | Low |AI assists, but a human artist directs, reviews, and approves the final result. | Photoshop AI-assisted upscaling, manual Topaz AI review, roto/mask suggestions | Final creative control rests with the artist; output is human-directed. |
| **Internal Use / Non-Deliverable** | No Approval Required | Low |AI used for technical or workflow efficiency, not deliverables. | Metadata tagging, mocap cleanup, 3D model topology extraction, simulation acceleration | These uses don’t generate expressive content, only optimize internal processes. |
| **Disclosure Required** | Producer/Studio Exec to Decide if Approval Needed | Medium | Gray areas where AI use may impact creative results depending on configuration. | SideFX Houdini ML plug-ins, experimental hybrid workflows | Disclosure ensures transparency; Producer/Execs review and decide if approval is required.

## Compliance with MPA and TPN+ Security Frameworks

The **Tool Disclosure List** is a core mechanism for demonstrating compliance with **MPA Content Security Best Practices v5.3.1 OR-5.0 (AI/ML Security Management)**. 

### Specifically, it:

1. **Supports Client Approval Requirements**

   * Provides a formal inventory of AI/ML tools for **client review and approval** before use in production.

   * Directly addresses the MPA requirement to **obtain client approval for AI/ML application use**.

2. **Manages Risk Transparently**

   * Categorizes tools by **risk level** (Low/Medium/High) and **AI Output Handling Category**, enabling structured risk management.

   * Satisfies the MPA requirement to **identify and manage risks** associated with datasets, applications, and infrastructure changes.

3. **Enforces Acceptable Use**

   * Ensures only tools listed and approved are permitted, integrating AI/ML oversight into the **Acceptable Use Policy (OR-1.1)**.

   * Meets the MPA requirement to **outline appropriate usage for AI/ML datasets and applications**.

4. **Provides an Audit Trail**

   * Serves as a **living document** — reviewed quarterly and updated upon introduction of new tools — ensuring **ongoing compliance and accountability**.

   * Demonstrates to auditors and clients that the studio has an **active, documented process** for managing AI/ML security.
