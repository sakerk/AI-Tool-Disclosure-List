# AI-Tool-Disclosure-List
These documents provide a generalized overview of both commercial and open-source AI-assisted tools commonly used in visual effects (VFX) and animation (ANM) production workflows. The intent is to support vendors, studios, and artists in maintaining transparency and compliance with contractual or legal requirements that may restrict or require prior approval for the use of AI technologies.

The tools described vary in form and integration. Some are embedded within industry-standard software, while others are standalone applications or interfaces layered on top of open-source or commercial platforms. These tools are typically used to enhance, accelerate, or automate specific production tasks. They do not generate original creative content autonomously, but rather assist artists in achieving production goals more efficiently and consistently.

Disclaimer:
This list is not exhaustive and is subject to periodic updates as new tools emerge and existing technologies evolve. We recommend reviewing the latest version prior to each production cycle to ensure continued compliance and transparency.
If you have any concerns, corrections, or additions, please submit them for review so we can maintain the accuracy and relevance of this resource.
